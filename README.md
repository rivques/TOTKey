# TOTKey
This is the TOTKey, a tool that generates time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) for 2-factor authentication. I don't always have my phone when I want to log into an account, so I built this. It's an RP2040-based #onboard PCB with a 128x32 OLED screen, a real-time clock, and a few buttons. The board runs CircuitPython, but it's all managed via WebSerial and a web interface at https://rivques.dev/random-raw-files/totkey.html. 
## CAD
The PCB design is on [OSHWLab](https://oshwlab.com/rivques/totkey). The case CAD is on [Onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/32d61313aac486cacbfbe708/w/44e7060cbffaacc1c37cc226/e/877546c851d313e0733d6d97).
